//! Assembled Wyrd client.
//!
//! [`WyrdClient`] is the single entry point a caller constructs once and then
//! uses for every request. It wires the four client layers together —
//! [`ClientConfig`] resolution, credential resolution, [`AuthMiddleware`] token
//! exchange/refresh, and the [`HttpTransport`] retry loop — behind one
//! constructor, so callers do not hand-assemble the stack per use site.
//!
//! The façade owns no request behavior of its own: `request_json`,
//! `request_arrow`, and `submit_idempotent` delegate to the held
//! [`HttpTransport`], which already injects the `x-wyrd-access-token` bearer and
//! applies the retry policy. gRPC is connected lazily via
//! [`WyrdClient::connect_grpc`], sharing the same [`AuthMiddleware`] so the HTTP
//! and gRPC planes authenticate through one token path.
